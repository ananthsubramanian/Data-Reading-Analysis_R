Assignment 05 Question 03
```{r question 03}
f <- as.data.table(final)
f1 <- f[,sum(`Amount of children`), by = c("Name","Gender")]
colnames(f1) <- c("Name", "Gender","Total")
View(f1)
f2 <- f1[order(f1$Total, decreasing = TRUE),]
head(f2,10)
f3 <- f1[grep("F$",f1$Gender)]
View(f3)
top_female_names <- f3
write.csv(top_female_names, "top_female_names.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
