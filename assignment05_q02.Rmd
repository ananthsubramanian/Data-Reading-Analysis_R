Assignment 5: Question 02

```{r question 02}
df1 <- read.csv("yob2016.txt", sep =";", header= FALSE)
df2 <- read.csv("yob2015.txt", sep = ",", header= FALSE)
tail(df2,10)

colnames(df1) <- c("Name","Gender","Amount of names")
colnames(df2) <- c("Name","Gender", "Amount of names")
final <- rbind(df2, df1)
na.omit(final)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
