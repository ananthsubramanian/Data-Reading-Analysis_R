Question 01: Assignment 05

```{r yob2016}
df <- read.csv("yob2016.txt", sep=";", header=FALSE)
colnames(df)<- c("Name","Gender","Amount of children")
df
summary(df)
str(df)
grep("yyy$",df$Name)
df[212,]
df1 <- df[-212,]
View(df1)
write.csv(df1,"yob2016.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
